HiSilicon STB PCIe host bridge DT description

HiSilicon PCIe host controller is based on Designware PCI core.
It shares common functions with PCIe Designware core driver and inherits
common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pci.txt.

Additional properties are described here:

Required properties
- compatible: Should be one of the following strings
		 "hisilicon,histb-pcie",
		 "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-pcie"
- reg: Should contain sysctl, rc_dbi, config registers location and length.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "sysctrl": system control registers of PCIe controller;
  "rc_dbi": configuration space of PCIe controller;
  "config": configuration transaction space of PCIe controller.
- interrupts: MSI interrupt.
- interrupt-names: Must include "msi" entries.
- clocks: List of phandle and clock specifier pairs as listed
		in clock-names property.
- clock-name: Must include the following entries:
  "aux_clk": auxiliary gate clock;
  "pipe_clk": pipe gate clock;
  "sys_clk": sys gate clock;
  "bus_clk": bus gate clock.
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs as listed
			in reset-names property
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  "soft_reset": soft reset;
  "sys_reset": sys reset;
  "bus_rest": bus reset.

Optional properties:
- power-gpios: pcie device power control gpio if needed;
- power-gpios-active-high: must include this propty
		if active level is high.
- status: Either "ok" or "disabled".

Example:

			<0xf0000000 0x2000>,
			<0xf2000000 0x01000000>;
		reg-names = "sysctrl", "rc_dbi", "config";
		#address-cells = <3>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		device_type = "pci";
		num-lanes = <1>;
		ranges=<0x81000000 0 0 0xf4000000 0 0x00010000
			0x82000000 0 0xf3000000 0xf3000000 0 0x01000000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 128 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "msi";
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-map-mask = <0 0 0 7>;

			 <&crg PCIE_BUS_CLK>;
		clock-names = "aux_clk", "pipe_clk", "sys_clk", "bus_clk";
		resets = <&crg 0x18c 6>, <&crg 0x18c 5>, <&crg 0x18c 4>;
		reset-names = "soft_reset", "sys_reset", "bus_reset";
	};
